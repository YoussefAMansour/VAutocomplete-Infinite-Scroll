# VAutocomplete-Infinite-Scroll-Component
This repository provides a Vue 3 component using Vuetify 3 that extends the VAutocomplete functionality with infinite scrolling capabilities. The component allows users to search for and select items from a dynamically loaded list from the API, ideal for applications with large datasets were loading all items at once is impractical.
